# Portfolio (React)

## Description

This is an updated page for my portfolio utilizing react.
This initial about me page gives you a shor description of me and my
histry. The portfolio page shows you a list of my projects that I have
worked on where you can click and view the websites. Contact allows
you submit your info for me to reach out to you, but at this point the
contact page doesn't just has the form and you can not submit the info.
